Console "Quiz game Yes/NO"

Hi, 
thanks for checking this. 
This is my first console program project in CodeAcademy school. Don't judge me: this is small step for everyone and big one personaly for me :)

What the project does:

1. Console program asks people YES-NO quesions.
2. User is asked (by input) to type  answer by choising "y" for YES or "n" for NO. 
3. Program checks if answe is correct or no.
4. Program sums up scores of correct answer and prints it out for user.

Why the project is useful for:

First of all, to have fun by trying to guess right answer.
Second, it might be usefull for begginers in Python programming, to learn some coding baiscs.

How to start:

Run quiz_game.py file in terminal
